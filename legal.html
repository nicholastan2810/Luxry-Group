  <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
  <p>Thank you for visiting our website at <a href="https://www.luxrygroup.com" target="_blank">https://www.luxrygroup.com</a> (the "Website"). Your access to and use of this Website, including any content, materials, and information made available on or through it (collectively, the "Materials"), is governed by these Terms of Use ("Terms").

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>This Website is maintained and operated by Luxry Capital Management Pte. Ltd. ("Luxry Capital"), a Singapore-incorporated private investment and advisory firm. For ease of reference, this Website may use terminology that suggests Luxry Capital operates as a singular entity. However, any references to "we," "our," or "us" may include related entities, each of which maintains a separate legal existence unless otherwise stated.</p>
  
  <h2>Materials</h2>
  <p>Unless otherwise noted, all Materials are provided "AS IS" and may not be relied upon for any purpose. We do not make any express or implied representations or warranties regarding the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, non-infringement, or fitness for a particular purpose of the Materials. Some content may be derived from third-party sources that we have not independently verified. Moreover, due to confidentiality obligations owed to our investors, portfolio companies, and partners, certain statements may be incomplete or subject to omission. You should interpret all Materials in light of these limitations. Please ensure your own systems are secure; Luxry Capital accepts no responsibility for malware or other harmful components that may be present in this Website or the Materials.</p>
