      <h1>Anti Fund</h1>
      <p class="tagline">ANTI FUND® is a venture capital firm founded by Jake Paul and Geoffrey Woo in 2021.</p>
      
      <p>Anti Fund believes the best founders are rebels, and the "anti" ethos resonates with the best engineers, scientists, and creators. Startups live and die on two levers: capital and attention. While capital is commodity, commanding attention is not. Whether a company sells consumer products or is a foundational research lab, they all must compete on the ability to win mindshare and ultimately customers and revenues.</p>
      
      <p>Venture capital returns are driven by iconoclasts who win. Anti Fund's mission is to find and fund these people.</p>
