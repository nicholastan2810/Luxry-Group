    <h1>ANTI is a Venture Fund.</h1>
    <p>We invest in attention â€” founders who are creators, and creators who are founders.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="about">
    <p>We believe media creates leverage and culture creates value. We invest in early stage companies, and support founders who know how to build community and speak internet.</p>
    <p>We are not afraid to be first. We make decisions quickly, trust our gut, and back bold ideas with speed and conviction.</p>
    <p>We are small, agile, and autonomous. We are unapologetically creator-led, culturally-informed, and distribution-obsessed.</p>
    <p>ANTI is founded by Josh Richards and Michael Gruen.</p>
    <p>We are based in LA, NY, and Miami.</p>
